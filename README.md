a game about love, inspired by "Your Boyfriend" game

"You are a normal slightly higher than minimum wage worker as a server at a restaurant after you moved in to a new town in a cheap apartment with a roommate. One day you meet a man at a park you frequent to calm down, and it was love at first sight! But how can you possibly get any attention from the downtrodden man? Whatever you can do, even if it takes drastic measures"
